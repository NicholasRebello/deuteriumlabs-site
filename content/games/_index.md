## 🏴‍☠️ Zero-Day {#zero-day}

{{< progressbar stage="Release" >}}

**Development Status:** Not started

*Infect systems. Evade firewalls. Rewrite the world.*

In **Zero-Day**, you are the architect of a rapidly evolving strain of malware. Starting from a single line of rogue code, your goal is global domination—one compromised node at a time. Inspired by the strategic gameplay of *Plague Inc.*, this game blends cyberpunk aesthetics with deep tactical decisions. Mutate your malware, exploit vulnerabilities, and outmaneuver digital defenses in a race against time and antivirus.
